  %p= "#{t :app} relies on a number of open source software libraries to help implement various features you see on the site. The three software components used most extensively throughout #{t :app} code are <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/'>Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery</a>, and <a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>Backbone.js</a>. These three components help structure code in a maintainable way, and implement several useful design patterns that allow #{t :app} to more easily respond to user interactions.".html_safe()
  %h2 Ruby on Rails 
  %p= "<a href='http://rubyonrails.org/'>Ruby on Rails</a> is a web framework favoring \"convention over configuration,\" and is programmed in the <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/'>Ruby</a> programming language. Rails has a large and thriving community with a number of open source libraries. Rails was a good choice for #{t :app} because it made it very easy to get a basic website up and running. Rails is also well tested and scalable, as demonstrated by the many popular websites that use it.".html_safe()
  %p Rails implements the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model View Controller</a> design pattern to help organize the code in a maintainable way. Models are used to represent and query data. Views render the data in a user-readable form that is shown by the web browser. Controllers connect the Models and Views by taking user input, telling the appropriate Model(s) to fetch the data, and sending that data to the appropriate View.
  %p= "Rails also uses the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern'>active record pattern</a> to implement <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping'>object-relational mapping</a>. #{t :app} uses the PostgreSQL database to store information on pictures, and ActiveRecord in Rails provides an easy way to interact with this database. With ActiveRecord, you can easily insert, query, update, and delete data without having to write verbose SQL. Using ActiveRecord in Rails also helps protect against <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection'>SQL injection</a> attacks.".html_safe()
  %h2 Backbone.js
  %p= "<a href='http://backbonejs.org/'>Backbone.js</a> is a client-side <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'>JavaScript</a> library that provides structure to JavaScript-heavy applications. #{t :app} is primarily a client-side application, only making calls to the Ruby on Rails backend with necessary, so Backbone was a clear choice for implementing the client-side functionality.".html_safe()
  %p Backbone code is organized in four components: Models, Views, Collections, and Routes. Models are used to interact with data retrieved from the server, while Collections hold a list of Models. Views present the data to the user, and can respond to user-interface events. Views can be associated with a collection of models or a single model, and can be set up to automatically update whenever that collection or model changes. The Router watches for changes in the URL and renders the appropriate View when the URL changes. The structure provided through these four components helps to reduce the amount of data transferred between the client and server, thus making responses to user interaction quicker.
  %p Backbone also has a built in history module that supports pushState. This allows for Backbone to change the URL without refreshing the whole page. Furthermore, this new URL is pushed into the browser history, so the browser back button still works as expected. For browsers that don't yet support pushState, Backbone falls back on using JavaScript's <i>window.location.hash</i> property.
  %h2 jQuery
  %p= "<a href='http://jquery.com/'>jQuery</a> is a JavaScript library for <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model'>DOM</a> traversal, manipulation, and event handling. jQuery is used extensively by #{t :app} to help provide consistent cross-browser functionality across many features. jQuery also helps respond to advanced events that are not supported by Backbone such as dragging. jQuery implements <a href='http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/'>a number of design patterns</a> to make DOM traversal and manipulation easier to deal with. jQuery is also easily extendable and has a number of useful plugins, such as the <a href='http://bgrins.github.com/spectrum/'>Spectrum</a>, <a href='http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/'>Chosen</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys'>jQuery Hotkeys</a> plugins that are used by #{t :app}.".html_safe()
  %h2 Fabric.js
  %p.last= "<a href='http://fabricjs.com/'>Fabric.js</a> is a JavaScript library that provides an \"interactive object model\" on top of the HTML5 <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element'>canvas element</a>. #{t :app} uses Fabric.js to help process image modifications and handle user events on the canvas element. Fabric.js features a very useful set of functions for resizing, rotating, and moving objects around on the canvas, as well as functions for modifying object properties such as color and transparency. Fabric.js objects include text, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics'>Scalable Vector Graphics</a>, basic shapes, and images.".html_safe()
